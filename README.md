## Info about PostgreSQL

**Hey folks. Bad news: I'm not working with PostgreSQL. I have no idea about it and therefore can not write any good software supporting PostgreSQL. 
I also don' t like it. For those reasons I will close all issues on this subject. Feel free to forke the bundle. Thanks for your understanding.**
